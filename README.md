This simple one-page website is a way for people to have a very quick and easy personable website that aggregates your activity and positions a simple logo, a portrait and some description text in a nicely-formatted manner. This is licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses.

2) Upload your own logo in place of icon.png. 

3) Upload your own portrait as the background.
